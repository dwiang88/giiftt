			<h2>A Trip Down Memory Lane</h2>
			<p>Every moment worth snapping is special. And every special moment deserve to be relived. Design a book that makes you want to go back in time and revisit those moments. Choose a sturdy hardcover – black or white – decorate it with your favorite snapshots and type in words that remind you of the good times.</p>

			<h2>High Quality Paper</h2>
			<p>We’ve chosen the best art paper, the thickest one we found. And when we print your book, we take two pages and stick it back to back. Then we add a matte finish to it. Thick paper and a matte finish – that’s how we ensure no wear and tear as your photos take you down memory lane time.</p>
